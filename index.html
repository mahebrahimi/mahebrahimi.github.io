          <strong>DARPA’s Role in Financing Innovation: Do Program Managers Have Private Information?</strong><br>
          (Job Market Paper, with Aldo Musacchio & Debarshi Nandy)<br>

            This paper provides an analysis of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) innovation funding model, emphasizing the pivotal role of Program Managers (PMs) in shaping outcomes. DARPA’s decentralized, high-risk, high-reward funding approach, combined with PM autonomy and expertise, is often credited as a model for fostering breakthrough technological advancements. Using a novel dataset spanning 2012–2019, we examine the mechanisms through which PMs allocate resources, test hypotheses surrounding private information, cherry-picking, and cronyism, and evaluate the resultant innovation impacts. Our findings reveal that PMs leverage both past performance and unique industry-specific knowledge gained through prior professional connections to select grantees capable of delivering superior innovation outcomes, as evidenced by increased patent filings, higher citation rates, and enhanced Department of Defense (DoD) contract awards. Contrary to concerns of cronyism, connected grantees outperform their peers, suggesting the informational advantage of PMs outweighs any potential bias. However, the concentration of funding among a few large grantees raises questions about the inclusivity of DARPA’s model in supporting smaller, nascent innovators. Still, our results underscore the importance of expertise-driven decision-making in navigating uncertainty and driving technological progress, while also advocating for strategies to balance support for established leaders and emerging disruptors in the innovation ecosystem.

          <strong>DARPA’s Role in Financing Innovation: A Descriptive Analysis of Funding Allocations and Outcomes</strong><br>
          (with Aldo Musacchio & Debarshi Nandy)<br>
          <button class="toggle-abstract">Show Abstract</button>
          <div class="abstract" style="display: none;">
            This paper provides the first systematic descriptive analysis of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) funding allocations and innovation outcomes using newly assembled project–grantee–year data covering 2012–2019. We link FOIA-obtained DARPA disbursements to grantee characteristics, program classifications, program manager (PM) biographies, USPTO patent outcomes, and Department of Defense follow-on contracts. Our analysis addresses four central questions raised in the literature on public R&amp;D: (i) whether different program types (basic, applied, advanced technology development) receive systematically different levels of funding; (ii) whether DARPA’s portfolio is concentrated among a small set of large grantees; (iii) whether lobbying intensity and political cycles shape allocations; and (iv) whether DARPA directs resources toward industries experiencing high growth, and with what outcomes. We further examine heterogeneity by grantee type (private, public, university) and PM background (industry, academia, military). The results highlight DARPA’s dual strategy of seeding entry by private firms while maintaining strong ties with established incumbents, and reveal systematic differences in continuation, concentration, and innovation outputs across grantee and allocator types. Beyond describing DARPA’s funding landscape, our findings establish a foundation for causal analysis of the DARPA's funding mechanisms.

          <strong>A New Dataset on DARPA’s Role in Financing Innovation</strong><br>
          (with Aldo Musacchio & Debarshi Nandy)<br>
          <button class="toggle-abstract">Show Abstract</button>
          <div class="abstract" style="display: none;">
            We introduce a new panel dataset of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), covering 2012–2019. Built from FOIA-obtained disbursement records, USAspending data, USPTO patent filings, and hand-collected PM biographies, the dataset links DARPA projects to innovation and adoption outcomes at project–grantee–program manager (PM)–year granularity. Our contributions are threefold. First, we connect DARPA awards to project-relevant patents and citations using a NAICS–CPC crosswalk, enabling field-specific measures of technological impact. Second, we compile biographical profiles of DARPA PMs, allowing analysis of how allocator discretion and prior experience shape funding outcomes. Third, we match DARPA-funded projects to follow-on Department of Defense contracts, tracing diffusion from R&amp;D to procurement. By providing DARPA-specific microdata that complement broad resources such as NIH grant–publication datasets and the Government Patent Register. This dataset offers a foundation for studying informational asymmetries, favoritism, and efficiency in public R&amp;D allocation.

          <strong>Does Having Student Debt Hurt Households’ Ability to Withstand Recessions?</strong><br>
          (with Karthik Krishnan & Pinshu Wang)<br>
          <button class="toggle-abstract">Show Abstract</button>
          <div class="abstract" style="display: none;">
            We assess the relationship between the level of educational debt and ability of households to withstand the negative impact of recessions that happen around the time they graduate from college. Households with higher student debt where household head experiences a recession shortly after graduation from college have lower family income and spend a shorter amount of time being employed in full time jobs. These effects are the strongest during the early part of one’s career, but weaken (in aggregate) after that. Our study indicates that policymakers and academics trying to understand the impact of recessions on economic outcomes may have to consider the impact of student loans.
